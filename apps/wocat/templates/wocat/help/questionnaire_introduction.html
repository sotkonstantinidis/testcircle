WOCAT focuses on efforts to prevent and reduce land degradation and restore degraded land through improved <strong>land management technologies</strong> and <strong>approaches to implement these</strong>. All practices may be considered, whether they are indigenous, newly introduced through projects, or recent innovations by land users. All information documented through WOCAT questionnaires is made available in the Global SLM Database and can be used to disseminate SLM knowledge and improve decision-making for further implementation and spreading of SLM practices." %}
